Since you're here, I'll guess you're inteested in 3DRecursion, a tool for visualizing and exploring recursion in the form of 3d models. Here you'll find the progress log for the project, chronicling all the stumblings I make along the way. Since I've never used WebGL (which 3DR will rely heavily on), I'll most likely be including the more important insights I encounter as I learn that tool, along with anything else interesting I run into regarding jQuery, Backbone.js, or even just JavaScript in general.

I'll also try to include at least a small post with each (non-minor) commit made, with a title matching that of the commit. In this way, you can look at the source being talked about by finding the commit with the corresponding date/message on Github (github.com/evanpurcer/3d-recursion).

That's all for now. More to come once I actually start building this thing.
