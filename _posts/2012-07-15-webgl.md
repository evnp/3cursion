title: Detecting WebGL
---
One of the best things I've found about Three.js is that the interface it provides for Canvas and WebGL, seem to be completely identical, the only difference being the renderer object that's used to render the scene. Because of this, I realized that it would be extremely easy to use Canvas and WebGL interchangeably.

This is a very good way to set things up because of the individual benefits of Canvas and WebGL. The benefit of WebGL is simple: it's able to utilize the system GPU, making it much more powerful than Canvas for rendering. The downside is that WebGL requires a very specific environment to even run - namely a modern browser and compatible graphics card. Canvas runs on most newer browsers, and does not depend on system hardware.

To get the best of both worlds, the solution is obvious: use WebGL when it's available, and fall back to Canvas if not. A rudimentary WebGL detector is included in Three.js, which most demo projects seem to use to display an error message when WebGL isn't available. I repurposed this detector into the app initialization code so that when the renderer is created, if WebGL is detected the WebGLRenderer type is used; otherwise the CanvasRenderer is fallen back on.
